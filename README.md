# Notifications Page built with React.js

This was a [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/doganfurkan) challenge. I've used react.js because I thought it would be good to use useState for the notification badge. I could have gone further with Redux, but it would get unnecessarily messier for a simple project like this.
